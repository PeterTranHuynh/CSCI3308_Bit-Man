You can activate the autowalk function by pull the cardboard trigger, by define a threshold angle or combine both by selecting both of these options. The threshold is an value in degree between 0° and 90°. So for example the threshold is 30°, the player will move when he is looking 31° down to the bottom and he will not move when the player is looking 29° down to the bottom. This script can easally be configured in the Unity Inspector.\+Attach this Script to your Cardboard\+Main-\/\+Game\+Object.
